view user
added id to Video root query for owner id
create link on avatar and username display
problem basically same component as channel minus ability to edit 
problem channel was using a no variable query based on jwt
solutions
1 - make nearly identical component for view-user copy paste?
2 - change channel query and add in some sort of check to see if viewer is owner


channel sub components

dropzone for channel art
user info
tabs
    home, videos, playlists, channels(subs), discussion, about, search
